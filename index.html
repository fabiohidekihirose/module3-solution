                    <h2>Chicken</h2>
                    <p>The chicken (Gallus gallus domesticus) is a type of domesticated fowl, a subspecies of the red junglefowl 
                        (Gallus gallus). Chickens are one of the most common and widespread domestic animals, with a total population 
                        of 23.7 billion as of 2018. up from more than 19 billion in 2011. There are more chickens in the world 
                        than any other bird or domesticated fowl. Humans keep chickens primarily as a source of food (consuming both 
                        their meat and eggs) and, less commonly, as pets. Originally raised for cockfighting or for special ceremonies, 
                        chickens were not kept for food until the Hellenistic period (4th–2nd centuries BC).

                        Genetic studies have pointed to multiple maternal origins in South Asia, Southeast Asia, and East Asia, but 
                        with the clade found in the Americas, Europe, the Middle East and Africa originating in the Indian subcontinent. 
                        From ancient India, the domesticated chicken spread to Lydia in western Asia Minor, and to Greece by the 5th 
                        century BC. Fowl had been known in Egypt since the mid-15th century BC, with the "bird that gives birth every 
                        day" having come to Egypt from the land between Syria and Shinar, Babylonia, according to the annals of 
                        Thutmose III.

                    <h2>Beef</h2>
                    <p>
                        Beef is the culinary name for meat from cattle, particularly skeletal muscle. Humans have been eating beef 
                        since prehistoric times. Beef is a source of protein and nutrients.
                        Most beef skeletal muscle meat can be used as is by merely cutting into certain parts, such as roasts, short 
                        ribs or steak (filet mignon, sirloin steak, rump steak, rib steak, rib eye steak, hanger steak, etc.), while 
                        other cuts are processed (corned beef or beef jerky). Trimmings, on the other hand, are usually mixed with 
                        meat from older, leaner (therefore tougher) cattle, are ground, minced or used in sausages. The blood is 
                        used in some varieties called blood sausage. Other parts that are eaten include other muscles and offal, such 
                        as the oxtail, liver, tongue, tripe from the reticulum or rumen, glands (particularly the pancreas and thymus, 
                        referred to as sweetbread), the heart, the brain (although forbidden where there is a danger of bovine 
                        spongiform encephalopathy, BSE, commonly referred to as mad cow disease), the kidneys, and the tender testicles 
                        of the bull (known in the United States as calf fries, prairie oysters, or Rocky Mountain oysters). Some 
                        intestines are cooked and eaten as is, but are more often cleaned and used as natural sausage casings. 
                        The bones are used for making beef stock. Meat from younger cows (calves) is called veal.
                        Beef from steers and heifers is similar. Depending on economics, the number of heifers kept for breeding 
                        varies. The meat from older bulls, because it is usually tougher, is frequently used for mince (known as ground 
                        beef in the United States). Cattle raised for beef may be allowed to roam free on grasslands, or may be confined 
                        at some stage in pens as part of a large feeding operation called a feedlot (or concentrated animal feeding 
                        operation), where they are usually fed a ration of grain, protein, roughage and a vitamin/mineral preblend.

                    <p>
                        Sushi (すし, 寿司, 鮨) is a Japanese dish of prepared vinegared rice (鮨飯, sushi-meshi), usually with some 
                        sugar and salt, accompanying a variety of ingredients (ネタ, neta), such as seafood, often raw, and vegetables.
                         Styles of sushi and its presentation vary widely, but the one key ingredient is "sushi rice", also referred to 
                         as shari (しゃり), or sumeshi (酢飯).
                        Sushi is traditionally made with medium-grain white rice, though it can be prepared with brown rice or 
                        short-grain rice. It is very often prepared with seafood, such as squid, eel, yellowtail, salmon, tuna or 
                        imitation crab meat. Many types of sushi are vegetarian. It is often served with pickled ginger (gari), 
                        wasabi, and soy sauce. Daikon radish or pickled daikon (takuan) are popular garnishes for the dish.
                        Sushi is sometimes confused with sashimi, a related dish in Japanese cuisine that consists of thinly sliced raw 
                        fish, or occasionally meat, and an optional serving of rice.
